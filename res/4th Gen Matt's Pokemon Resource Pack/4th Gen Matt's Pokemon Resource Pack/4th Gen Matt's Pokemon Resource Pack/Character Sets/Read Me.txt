This Pokemon Resource Pack was assembled by 4th Gen Matt.
It contains a complete Kanto and Johto tileset, complete
soundtracks from Pokemon FR/LG, G/S, R/S, D/P, and Pokemon Colosseum
As well as all 493 Pokemon cries.  It also contains about 300
character sets, all of the Platinum sprites, both normal and shiny,
and every form of Arceus as well as the secret 18th form.

If you use this resource pack, give credit to me as well as everyone
listed below in the credits.  It would be greatly appreciated.

If you need to contact me for any reason, send me a private
message at the PokeCommunity forums.  My username there is
4th Gen Matt.

This resource pack does not currently have a complete Sinnoh
or Hoenn tileset.  If you have or know of one that I can use,
then send me a PM on PokeCommunity with the download link.
